# heart-failure-prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on medical attributes. Using a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant clinical features, the goal is to apply various machine learning algorithms to accurately classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

The dataset is from kaggle and can be found here:
